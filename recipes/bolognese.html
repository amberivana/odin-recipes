    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This classic Bolognese sauce is a rich, slow-simmered rag√π that embodies the heart of Italian comfort food. 
            Unlike a quick weeknight meat sauce, an authentic Bolognese builds its depth of flavor over hours, starting with a 
            soffritto of finely diced onions, carrots, and celery. A combination of ground beef and pork (or pancetta for an even 
            richer taste) is then browned to perfection, creating a savory foundation before the addition of dry white wine for 
            deglazing, and a judicious amount of milk, which tenderizes the meat and adds a subtle creaminess. Tomatoes, either 
            crushed or passata, are then introduced, along with a touch of beef or chicken stock, allowing the sauce to gently bubble 
            and reduce, concentrating its flavors into a velvety, complex masterpiece.</p>
        <p>The magic of Bolognese truly unfolds during its long, slow simmer, as the diverse ingredients meld together into a 
            harmonious whole. This extended cooking time not only tenderizes the meat to a meltingly soft consistency 
            but also allows the natural sugars in the vegetables to caramelize and sweeten, balancing the richness of 
            the meat and tomatoes. The resulting sauce is remarkably versatile, traditionally served with wide, flat 
            pasta like tagliatelle or pappardelle, which are perfect for capturing every last drop of the luscious sauce.</p>

    <!--Steps-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil and butter (if using) in your large pot over medium-low heat, then if using pancetta, add it and cook gently until its fat has rendered and it's slightly golden, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the finely diced onion, carrot, and celery to the pot and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft and translucent but not browned, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium, add the ground beef and pork (or your chosen meat mix) to the pot, breaking up the meat as it cooks until it's no longer pink and has started to brown slightly.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high, pour in the red wine, bring to a simmer, scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, and let the wine almost completely evaporate.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in the whole milk and add the pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, stir well, and continue to simmer gently until the milk has almost completely evaporated and absorbed into the meat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato puree (passata) or crushed tomatoes and bay leaves (if using), then bring the sauce to a very gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer for at least 2-3 hours, or even longer (up to 4 hours), stirring occasionally and adding hot broth or water if the sauce becomes too thick.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the simmering time, taste the sauce and adjust salt and pepper as needed, then remove the bay leaves before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve your Bolognese hot, traditionally with wide, flat pasta like tagliatelle or pappardelle, or with rigatoni, tossing the cooked pasta directly with the sauce for a minute or two.</li>
        </ol>
